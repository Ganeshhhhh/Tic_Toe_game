# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**Tic-Tac-Toe Game** is a classic two-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to align three symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project is a great way to showcase basic game logic, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI design.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' on the grid.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects when a player has won by forming a straight line or when the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Option**: Players can restart the game after completion.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: No backend is needed for this simple version, but a server can be added for an online multiplayer mode.

## How to Play

1. **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Player 1 is 'X', and Player 2 is 'O'. They take turns selecting an empty space on the 3x3 grid.
2. **Win Condition**: The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
3. **Draw Condition**: If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
4. **Restart**: After a win or a draw, click the 'Restart' button to play again.
